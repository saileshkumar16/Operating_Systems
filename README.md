# Operating Systems

**My personal OS knowledge base â€“ concise notes + critical C questions.**

This folder contains my **customised notes** on core Operating System concepts,  
along with **critical C-based questions** that connect OS theory to practical implementation.

## ðŸ“Œ What's Inside
- Handwritten & customised OS notes for quick revision
- Important concepts like:
  - Process management
  - Memory management
  - Scheduling algorithms
  - Synchronisation & deadlocks
  - File systems & I/O handling
- C-based problem statements and solutions related to OS concepts

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
- Keep OS concepts **clear, concise, and practical**
- Bridge the gap between **theory** and **hands-on C coding**
- Serve as a **quick reference** before interviews or exams

## ðŸ›  Usage
Simply open the notes or code files directly.  
Compile C programs using:
```bash
gcc filename.c -o output
./output
